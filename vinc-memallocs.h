 *   Some notes:
 *
 *   Naming Conventions
 *
 * Yes, I am using postfix `_t` for types defined by typedef. I know that it's'
 * bad, It's a matter of personal preference, and you can either use
 * `struct ...` type variation, just find and remove them in code. I justify
 * this by  using `vinc_` prefix.
